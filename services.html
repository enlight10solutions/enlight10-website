      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        We focus on two things: <strong>building Watchtower</strong> — our emerging SOC platform — and
        <strong>supporting government and defense partners</strong> with practical cybersecurity and contracting services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re intentionally small and hands-on. Our work is grounded in real-world security operations:
        SOC shifts, incident response, engineering, and the day-to-day reality of keeping critical missions online.
